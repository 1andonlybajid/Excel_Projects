I follow a structured workflow. First, I import the dataset and clean it by removing duplicates, fixing missing values, correcting data types, and standardizing categories. Then I transform the data using formulas or Power Query to create calculated columns and make the dataset analysis-ready.

After that, I use Pivot Tables for exploratory analysis to identify trends, patterns, and key metrics. I calculate KPIs like totals, averages, growth rates, or RFM metrics depending on the project. Then I visualize insights using charts and build an interactive dashboard with slicers and timelines.

Finally, I summarize actionable insights and recommendations based on the data.
